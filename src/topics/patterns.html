    <h2 class="slide-title">What's a design pattern?</h2>
    <p class="hint">Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.</p>
    <p class="hint">Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.</p>

    <h2 class="slide-title">Why are design patterns important?</h2>
    <p class="hint"><strong>They're tried and tested:</strong> With a design pattern, you have a tried-and-tested solution to your problem (as long as the design pattern fits the description of your problem).</p>
    <p class="hint"><strong>They're reusable:</strong> Since these patterns are a standard way of solving problems, their designers have taken care to ensure that the encompassing app architecture remains reusable, flexible, and compatible with most forms of writing code.</p>
    <p class="hint"><strong>They're easy to understand:</strong> Design patterns are meant to be small, simple, and easy to understand. They're purposefully generic (not limited to any particular programming language) and can be understood by anyone who has sufficient problem-solving skills.</p>

    <h2 class="slide-title">Design Patterns Classification</h2>
    <p class="hint"><strong>Creational patterns</strong> provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.</p>
    <p class="hint"><strong>Structural patterns</strong> explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.</p>
    <p class="hint"><strong>Behavioral patterns</strong> take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</p>
